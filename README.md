Movie Explorer is a React-based web application that allows users to search for movies, view details, and manage a list of favorite movies. The application interacts with The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch and display movie data, including popular movies, movie details, and search results. Users can sign up, log in, and explore various movie categories, adding their favorite movies to a personalized list.

Features

Approach
The project was built with a focus on modularity and reusability of components. React Router was utilized for client-side routing, ensuring a seamless navigation experience.

The integration with TMDB's API was done using fetch, with error handling implemented to ensure a robust user experience.
